Description: Synergy inference by data-driven network-based Bayesian analysis (SINBA) is a tool designed to translate insights from network-based systems biology into reverse pharmacology applications. By leveraging advanced computational approaches, SINBA significantly reduces the time and resources required for conventional combination drug screening. Additionally, SINBA integrates a drug-target database focused on blood-brain barrier penetration, facilitating accelerated drug discovery for central nervous system (CNS) tumors.
